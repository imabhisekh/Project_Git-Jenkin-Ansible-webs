in this we have used github(developer end), Jenkins (for ci) ansible (as infra ,use to direct traffic on webserver)  webserver 

we have three servers jenkins , Ansible, Webserver
now we have to make passwordless communication between the servers (jenkins to Ansible) (Ansible to Webserver)
for that first we set password and key gen for each and every instance #passwd root  and generate key #ssh-keygen
then we modify config file for passworrdless communication on every instance  # vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config in that we uncomment {permitrootlogin yes} and {passwordauthentication yes}.
then update the kernel bcz you change in config file # systemctl reload sshd
now apply this commnad to communicate between (jenkin to ansible) on jenkin # ssh-copy-id -i root@PVT_IP_Ansible   (to check use ssh  root@pvt ip of ansible )
                                           (ansible to webserver) on ansible # ssh-icopy-id -i root@PVT_IP_Webserver
now in Ansible server add private ip of webserver in hosts file # vim /etc/ansible/hosts    in line 17 [web] paste pvt ip below
now create directory in ansible or where developer say for ex i have created dir # mkdir /sourcecode in that create playbook.yaml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
     -copy:
       src: /opt/index.html    this file will come after compiling jenkins server and it will come in asible /opt folder
       dest: /var/www/html     so now this file will run on webserver so we mention dest of webserver 
       
now we go github where our code is 
   we are integrating github with jenkins using webhook 
   > goto that repo and select setting >webhook > addwebhok >payload url (jenkin_url/github-webhook)
      content type  (application/json) > secrete (go to jenkins tap on username, configure,addtoken and generate copy that token and paste in secrete)
      now install plugin on jenkin [public over ssh ] this will build communication with servers.
      
 we need to add credential of ssh in jenkins  go to > manage jenkins > configure system > scroll down > in ssh server  > add in that 
 Name (jenkins), Hostanme (private ip of jenkin), Username (root), tap on Advance Use password tick on that add password of root  apply save .
 now create job frestyle > Source code management >use git add http link of repo and if bellow error showing so go to jenkin server and install #yum install git
 now simply  go to build . so it will create workspace  now goto jenkin server and # cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/project_name #pwd copy path 

and go to jenkin console and now open that project and configure  in that add SCM git url >BUILD (send file or execute command over ssh) name (jenkins) and 
 
 >Build Triggers (github hoot trigger for GITScm pulling) we use this for when we change in our git repo code it will run automatically on jenkins 
    build and show to web.
 in Exec command  write ## rsync -avh /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/project_name/*.html root@pvt_ip_Ansible ( so it will copy file to ansible in /opt)
 
 then below POST-BUILD ACTION in that > Name (Ansible) Exec command ## ansible-playbook /sourcecode/playbook.yml ( it will run ansible playbook so the file from /opt go to destination on web server)
                                                                        <command>  <path_of_directory> <playbook_name>
 Now build . it will done  past url of webserver in webbrowser. you will get output .
 
 
 
 So, if code will change in git hub repom it will automatically build and shown on web browser 
 
 
 some commands from developer  in developer server 
 #git clone http_urlof git repo
 # goto project 
 # vim index.html (sourcecode)
 add content 
 #git commit -m "commit name "
# git push origin master
